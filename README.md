# python-import-check
Check which of your dependencies are not being imported anywhere in your project.

## Installation
Clone the repository, and setup the virtualenv and dependencies:
`pipenv install`

## Usage
Example: `pipenv run python import-check.py --graph ~/app/graph.json --path ~/app`
Parameter:
`--graph`: Location of the graph.json file generated by pipenv which describes your installed repositories
`--path`: Root path of your Python project
`--package-path`: Root path of the `site-packages` directory for your projects. Defaults to `path` + `/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages`
`--exclude`: List of directories to exclude when parsing your imports. Defaults to `__pycache__,venv,static,node_modules`
`--uninstall`: Optionally include a uninstall string for pip

## Notes
This tool doesn't require your project to be in pipenv, but does require a depedencies graph generated via pipenv. If your project currently just lives off a pipfile, you can use pipenv to create a Pipfile off of that, and then a graph.json (and simply remove them when you're done):
`pipenv lock`
`pipenv graph --json`

## TODO
* Parse dependency graph directly from the `package-path` and remove the dependency on `graph.json`
* Handle Django use cases more intelligently (e.g., parse settings.py files as well)
